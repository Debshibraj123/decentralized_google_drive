# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Decentralized Google Drive
Overview

This is a decentralized Google Drive project implemented using Solidity, Hardhat, EtherJS, and Pinata. It allows users to store and retrieve images in a decentralized manner.

Prerequisites

Node.js
Hardhat
EtherJS
Pinata account
Setup

Clone this repository.
Install the dependencies:
npm install
Create a Pinata account and obtain your API key and secret.
Add your API key and secret to the .env file.
Deployment

Deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
Replace <network> with the name of the blockchain network you want to deploy to, such as localhost or rinkeby.

Once the smart contract is deployed, copy the contract address.
Usage

To store an image in the decentralized Google Drive, you will need to call the uploadImage() function in the smart contract. You can do this using a Web3 library, such as EtherJS.

const web3 = new Web3(ethereum.provider);

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(
  [
    // ABI of the smart contract
  ],
  contractAddress
);

const image = await contract.methods.uploadImage(imageBuffer).send({ from: accountAddress });
Replace <imageBuffer> with the buffer of the image you want to upload.
Replace <accountAddress> with the address of the Ethereum account you are using.

Once the image is uploaded, you can retrieve it using the getImage() function in the smart contract.

const image = await contract.methods.getImage(imageId).call();
Replace <imageId> with the ID of the image you want to retrieve.

Conclusion

This is a simple example of how to create a decentralized Google Drive using Solidity, Hardhat, EtherJS, and Pinata. You can use this as a starting point to build your own decentralized storage application.

Additional Notes

You can use a frontend framework, such as React or Vue, to build a user interface for your decentralized Google Drive.
You can use a decentralized file sharing network, such as IPFS or Swarm, to store the images.
You can use a smart contract to implement additional features, such as access control and encryption.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
